# Exercise 1 (points = 36)

Below are some arguments.  For each argument try to determine whether or not it is valid. If it is valid, you answer needs to be "Valid (\<specify-inference-rule\>)". If it is invalid, your answer needs to be  "Invalid".

For example, your answer to the following arguments should be "Valid (Modus Ponens)". You do not need to explain.


-   If it rains, the ground is wet.
-   It rains.
-   Therefore, the ground is wet.

# Exercise 2 (points = 16)

Use inference rules to show the following argument is valid. To assist your writing, you can provide a list of sentences that look like this: `From  "...", we have "..." following "..."`. Example: From premises "p" and "p->q", we have "q" following the inference rule "Modus Ponens".  

Premises

-   p ∨ q
-   q -> r
-   p ∧ s -> t
-   ∼r
-   ∼q → u ∧ s

Conclusion

-   t


# Exercise 3 (points = 12)

Rewrite the statements below using quantifiers and variables. For example, a statement like "Even numbers are divisible by 2" becomes: "for each even number n, n is divisible by 2", or "for each number n, if n is an even number, then n is divisible by 2". You do not necessarily need to use the exact words or patterns as above. 

1.  No two leaves are alike.
2.  Even integers equals twice some integer.
3.  The sum of two positive integers is a positive number.


# Exercise 4 (points = 18)

Write a negation for each statement below. For example, the negation of "for any real number x, if x \* x > 4 then x > 2" is "there exists a real number x, x \* x > 4 and x <= 2".   

1.  for any real numbers x, y, z, (x + y) + z  equals to x + (y + z).
2.  for any integer d, if 11 / d is an integer then d = 11.
3.  for any real number x, if x \* (x + 5) > 0 then x > 0 or x < −5.
4.  for any positive integer n, if n is prime then n is odd or n = 2.
5.  for any integers a, b and c, if a − b is even and b − c is even, then a − c is even.
6.  for any integer n, if n is divisible by 6, then n is divisible by both 2 and 3.


# Exercise 5 (points = 18)

Determine whether the statements below are true or false. You do not need to give the reasons. 



1.  42k is an even number for any integer k.

2.  For each integer n with 2 <= n <= 6, n<sup>2</sup> − n + 11 is a prime number.

3.  The average of any two odd integers is odd.

4.  For any real number x, if x \* x >= 4, then x >= 2.

5.  For any real numbers x and y, x<sup>2</sup> - 2xy + y<sup>2</sup> >= 0.

6.  There exists an integer x, such that (2x + 1)<sup>2</sup> is even.
