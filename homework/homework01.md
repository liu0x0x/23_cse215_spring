# Exercise 1. (score = 10)

Check if the two statement forms below are logically equivalent. Explanation is needed (e.g. based on the truth table). 


-   p \\/ q -> r
-   (p -> r) /\\ (q -> r)

# Exercise 2 (score = 10)

Check if the two statement form are equivalent. Explanation is needed (e.g. based on the truth table). 

-   (p -> q) /\\ (q -> r) /\\ (r -> p)
-   p /\\ q /\\ r


# Exercise 3 (score = 10)


Explanation can be omitted for this exercise.

Consider six statement forms (a-f):

- (a) p -> q 

- (b) q -> p

- (c) ~p \\/ q

- (d) ~q \\/ p

- (e) ~q -> ~p

- (f) ~p -> ~q



1. Find all statement forms that are equivalent to (a), expect (a) itself.
2.  Find all statement forms that are equivalent to (b), expect (b) itself.




# Exercise 4 (score = 5)

Consider the proposition ~P ∧ (Q → P). What can you conclude about P and Q if you know the statement is true? Explanation is needed (e.g. based on the truth table). 



# Exercise 5 (score = 15)

For each  statement form below, determine  if it is a tautology, contradiction, or neither. Explanation is needed (e.g. based on the truth table). 


1.  (∼p \\/ q) \\/ (p /\\ ∼q)
2.  (p /\\ ∼q) ∧ (∼p \\/ q)
3.  (p /\ q) \\/ (∼p \\/ (p /\\ ∼q))




# Exercise 6 (score = 20)
Determine whether the argument form below is valid. Explanation is needed (e.g. based on the truth table). 

(1)

-   premises: p -> q,  q
-   conclusion: p

(2)

-   premises: p-> q, ~p
-   conclusion: ~q

(3)

-   premises: p-> q, p
-   conclusion: q

(4)

-   premises: p-> q, ~q
-   conclusion: ~p


# Exercise 7 (score = 30)

Use truth tables to determine whether the argument form below is valid. Explanation is needed (e.g. based on the truth table). 

(1)

-   Premises: p -> q,  ~p -> ~q
-   Conclusion:  p \\/ q

(2)

-   Premises: p \\/ q, p -> ~q, ~r -> ~p
-   Conclusion: r

(3)

-   Premises: p, ~q -> ~p,  ~q \\/ r
-   Conclusion r

(4)

-   Premises: p/\q -> ~r,  p \\/ ∼q,  ∼q -> p
-   Conclusion: ~r

(5)

-   Premises: p -> r, q -> r
-   Conclusion: (p \\/ q) -> r

(6)

-   Premises: p -> (q \\/ r),  ~q \\/ ~r
-   Conclusion: ∼p \\/ ∼r
